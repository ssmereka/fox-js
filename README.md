# Fox [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ssmereka/fox-js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/ssmereka/fox-js)


Exactly what you need to get started building a scalable web application using javascript.  Fox-JS is a mixture of boilerplate code and a light framework for creating both the backend and frontend of a web application.  Fox-JS frontend is built on angular-js and the backend using node-js.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the fox-js repo

    git clone https://github.com/ssmereka/fox-js.git

2. Give your project a name, install fox, and start the server.

    sudo chmod +x fox && ./fox "My Project Name"

3. Start coding!  No need to restart the server, changes will be live after saving a file.

If you need to stop, start, or restart the server simply:

    fox stop "My Project Name"
    fox start "My Project Name"
    fox restart "My Project Name"
